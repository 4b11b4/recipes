Trial 1
1. 4 min

Trial 2
1. 4 minutes beans are over cooked.
2. Saute onions & garlic. Slightly less water. Fill to right at the level of everything instead of slightly above. 3 min instead of 4 min.

*Tried to convert into black bean soup as well:
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1/4 tsp cayenne
- 1/2 tsp salt before pressure cook. can add more after

3 mins was better. Filled water to about even rather than slightly above. Still slightly too much water. Can do slightly below. Salty enough. 1 tsp per cup. Probably slightly less is better if doing more than 1 cup. 1 cup didn't make very much when doing black bean soup. Could add 1/2 more tsp cumin. Needs a little more flavor. The 1/4 tsp cayenne per cup is just a little bit of a kick. Need chili powder.

Trial 3
Black Bean Soup
- 2 cups beans
- 3 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp cayenne
- 1/2 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp salt
- water a little more than slightly below
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp ground black pepper

3 min
natural release
blend half of it
results: was a little bit thicker this time due to less water. scooped about half the beans out, drained all water into blender. liquified it a little bit more this time. it turned out more like a bean dip than soup. next time try water level BARELY under level of beans. also maybe roughly blend it rather than liquify.
