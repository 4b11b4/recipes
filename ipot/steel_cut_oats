Trial #1
2c oats

1/8 tsp salt
* very liquidy still. oats not cooked all the way.
** brought to pressure for another 1 min
*** pretty much fully cooked now. not much liquid left. can add liquid
    when reheating. maybe go for 5-6 minutes next time...
*** could add more liquid next time. only added 2.25c / 3c

Trial #2
same as #1, but used red measuring cup for water
* couldn't get to pressure, ran out of water...
** added 1c more water of red cup and set back to 4 min
* read measuring cup is actually 3/4 of liquid cup

Trial 3
2c water
0.5c hwc
7min 
instant release
* not done enough
** add 0.5c water
** manual 1 min
** more done, but 0.5c wasn't enough water, began to stick on bottom
** since a short amount of cooking time, didn't burn though
*** maybe try 2.5c, 10 min, natural release?

2c milk (clear)
2c oats (green meas cup)
